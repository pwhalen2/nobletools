# nobletools
Noble Tools Suite, is a set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and Application Programming Interfaces (API) written in Java for interfacing with ontologies, auto coding text and extracting information from free test. The Noble Tools suite also includes a generic ontology API for interfacing with Web Ontology Language (OWL) files, OBO and BioPortal ontologies and a number of support utilities and methods useful for NLP (e.g. string normalization, ngram and stemming)
